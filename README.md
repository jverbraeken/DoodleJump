## Synopsis

Doodle Jump aims to provide the same playing experience as the original Doodle Jump, but combined however with a few extra features that make it stand out from the original game and other clones.
Notable features:
- Multiple themes

## Motivation

Alberto Bachelli, client of this project, requested us (see Contributors) to make a clone of a game to train both our teamwork and our Java programming skills. We decided to choose Doodle Jump because there is much room for new features.

## Installation

Import as a Maven project in Intellij Idea and build with Maven (3.0.4).

## Tests

4 testing frameworks are used:
- JUnit 4.12
- Cucumber (Java 8 edition)
- Mockito 1.6.5
- Powermockito 1.6.5

To ensure the code quality 3 additional frameworks are used:
- PMD 4.3
- CheckStyle 7.0
- Findbugs 2.5.2
